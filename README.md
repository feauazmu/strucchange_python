# Dating Structural Changes in Linear Regression Models - A Python implementation

In this repository you can find the code for my final project of the effective programming course taken at the University of Bonn.

Here you can find the workplace I used to build a function called `breakpoints` that finds one or more structural breaks on data for linear regression models based on the method explained by <cite>Bai, Perron (2003)</cite>. The code of the function is influenced on the `R` package [`strucchange`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=strucchange) to a great extent.

## Getting Started

This project uses a [Template for Reproducible Research Projects in Economics](https://econ-project-templates.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html).  For prerequisites and installation please follow the instructions on the webpage.

Please not that, after the setup, running `waf.py build` will run a number of analysis and tests, including a timing test on the function that can take some time.
